<h1>Gemdation's Piracy Guide</h1>

<a href="../guides"><button>Back</button></a>

<p>Welcome to this brief personal guide on how I pirate media, what I pirate, and what I don't. Red flags,
   jackpots, and the gambling. Maybe not the gambling but we'll see!</p>

<h2 id="Precautions">Precautions</h2>

<p>Anti-piracy fellows will say a risk is that you might end up with a virus or some scary pop-ups! These
   <em>are</em> true but you can guard your browser with the amazing adblock known as uBlock Origin! (And
   Microsoft Defender.)</p>

<h3>uBlock Origin</h3>
<p>is a content blocker that is known for it's amazing ad-zapping abilities. It can even turn a news article's
   Times Squares amount of advertisement into a simple webpage. If you browse on TV/Movie piracy sites, pop-ups
   and advertisements will also cease!</p>

<h3>Microsoft Defender</h3>
<p style="color:#9c8153e0">if you aren't on a Windows machine, don't worry about this, worry instead about how to use your operating system. :tro:</p>
<p>Just kidding, Linux has been worry-free in the virus side of things and I'm sure macOS does a good job of
   that as well. The websites I go to are reliable or are trust worthy <em>enough</em>. So Microsoft Defender is a
   little safe gaurd for your browsing and downloads. Keep in mind that you might run into false positives.</p>

<h3>Pirated Windows</h3>

<p>Just kidding this isn't a real precaution but I'm adding it here for fun,
   <a href="https://massgrave.dev" style="color:purple"><b>massgrave.dev</b></a> is what I used to get my
   Windows 11 LTSC operating system. I have mixed feelings about Linux since WINE is not the best for all old
   games and tools.</p>

<h2 id="Sources">Sources</h2>

<h3>Myrient</h3>
<p>The Myrient has an amazing collection of old titles and is my go to for any console games, it has nice speeds
   along with it's...kinda weird navigation? Granted I <em>do</em> find what I want but I'd wish they had a better
   directory system in place.</p>

<a href="https://myrient.erista.me/"><button>Visit the Myrient</button></a> <b>for older console games and more!</b>

<h3>Internet Archive</h3>
<p>My would-be favorite if the download speeds weren't so slow, the Internet Archive has the world's most massive
   user-uploaded content repository. From PopCap Games to an entire SpongeBob SquarePants catalog, the digital
   library likely has something for you!</p>

<p>This and Wikipedia are the only websites I have donated to.</p>

<a href="https://www.archive.org/"><button>Visit the Internet Archive</button></a> <b>and look around for something you like!</b>

<h3>My Abandonware</h3>
<p>A little thing I like to do is play weird obscure games! This website seems like it has quite a nice collection.
   This is where I rediscovered SpongeBob PC games, Marble Blast Ultra, and Viva Pinata. Occasionally some games
   aren't activated.</p>

<h3>MarioCube</h3>
<p>This is a group that hosts Wii, Wii U, Nintendo DS(i), and GameCube ROMs on Google Drive. I'm not a fan of
   what they make people do to get access to the bigger ROMs. For instance, WiiWare ROMs are in a public
   repository while Wii disc games require you to be a member of their Google Drive group. This idea doesn't sit
   well with me as the group owner will see your Google Account's name and email. Not to mention the owner...
   which is a whole different thing.</p>

<h3>The Pirate Bay and 1377x</h3>
<p>During the early years of this computer (2020-2022) I used to torrent a lot with qBittorent, so there's this.
   I must add that if anyone is actually following this guide and is also tech illterate, do not let this be your
   first choice. Seeding 24/7 without a VPN could get you a letter sent to you from your ISP <span style="color:#9c8153e0">(heh)</span>.</p>

<p>I used magnet sites like these for full season collections of cartoons like SpongeBob SquarePants and The
   Amazing World of Gumball. Some collections had combined episodes in one file so I had to manually split them,
   ew.</p>

<h3>YouTube (Music) ReVanced Extended</h3>
<p>For ad-free, sponsor-free, dislike-returning YouTube clients, ReVanced Extended applies an amazing assortment
   of patches to APK files. Note for the Music app you won't be able to switch between Audio and Video like you
   are with a genuine Premium subscription.</p>

<p>Fun Fact: I use to manually download music as MP3s until I found out I could use a client like this. (YouTube
   Music Vanced at the time)</p>

<a href="https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-manager/releases/latest"><button>Download RVX Patcher</button></a> <b>to get started!</b>

<h3>NUSspli and 3hs</h3>
<p>These are simple yet handy homebrew tools for downloading free games directly on the (homebrewed) console,
   hopefully you aren't impatient. NUSspli is for the Wii U, and 3hs is for the Nintendo 3DS. 3hs is a client for
   the hShop team, which is also owned by Erista, the group behind Myrient.</p>

<b>3hs</b>: <a href="https://hshop.erista.me/3hs"><button>Download the CIA</button></a> <b> and install it with the FBI app!</b>
<br>
<b>NUSpli</b>: <a href="https://github.com/V10lator/NUSspli?tab=readme-ov-file#install"><button>View the instructions</button></a> <b>to get started! Aroma and Tiramisu are supported.</b>

<h3>qBittorent</h3>
<p>If you're heading to torrent sites, I greatly recommend this program. That's all.</p>

<h2 id="Notes">Notes</h2>
<p>Here are some little notes from my experience on the Internet.</p>

<h3>Adblocker</h3>
<p>uBlock forever! Whether it is the original Origin version or the Lite one, it's fine. Just make sure it's on.</p>

<h3>Redirects</h3>
<p>If a website redirects you, it's likely fine. Websites don't always host their own listings <b>but</b> 
   sometimes it's important to look at the URL bar. If you see that you are getting tossed around with 3 or more
   redirects, it is best to close the tab and others that have opened due to it.</p>

<h3>Verification</h3>
<p>Occasionally you will run into some verification windows, these are normal and are commonly used to prevent bots
   from spamming the website's servers. You might even see <a href="../../media/cloudflare-screen.png" style="color:#ff8800"><b>this</b></a>
   screen.</p>


<p><b>If a verification website requires you "activate" from a notification permission, or any other browser
      permission, try to look somewhere else for your content.</b> If you do need whatever site it is, remember to
      take away the site's permissions afterwards.</p>

<h2 id="Summary">Summary</h2>
So basically:
<ul>
    <li>I go online with an adblocker always on</li>
    <li>I can look elsewhere for content</li>
    <li>I am skeptical of sites if loading is taking too long or permissions are requested</li>
    <li>I don't like having to join private groups</li>
    <li>Microsoft Defender is my safe guard</li>
    <li>Torrent if neccessary</li>
</ul>
