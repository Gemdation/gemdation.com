    <h1>Early Days</h1>
    <h4>January 27, 2024</h4>

    <p>This is a little port of a Library page I had. These were smartphones I've used likely during 2011-2013</p>

    <h2>HTC Phone</h2>

    <p>The first ever smartphone I used was a little Android phone by HTC. It was used for playing Angry Birds,
    creating my first <span class="hide">(now lost)</span> Google account, and creating my
    <span class="hide">(now deleted)</span> Facebook account. This phone had issues with performance, battery
    memory <span class="hide">(you'll see)</span>, Wi-Fi, and being durable.</p>

    <p>I remember one time Angry Birds kept playing music after I closed the game and that scared me enough to
    remove the battery. If the battery happened to be pulled out while the number was at 100% and I put it back
    in and rebooted, it would be at 40%. For example, one time in my grandma's house I accidentally dropped the
    phone when it was at 100%, rebooted it, and saw that it went back to 20%.</p>

    <p>Downloading games from the Play Store also sucked, and I kept running into the low storage message. One thing I
    remember doing was seeing the Low Storage message, and then thinking I could download other apps to keep on
    downloading. This somehow worked but that was probably because I got apps with lower sizes.</p>


    <h2><a href="../../media/ZTE Sonata 2.png">ZTE compact phone</a></h2>

    <p>This phone was my mom's tiny phone that was a handy portal to YouTube. It was used for watching FNAF animation
    videos, and not used for playing the game or even let's plays. Do you happen to know someone named hotdiggedydemon and EthGoesBOOM? :P</p>


    <h2>iPhone 4</h2>
    <p>This was one also my mom's that I used to watch YouTube on, with a special bonus from iTunes. I watched a
        3D-animated Nickelodeon show called <i>Robot and Monster</i> that I believe was purchased from iTunes Store.
    </p>
    <p>On YouTube, I saw even more 3D-animated videos. Rabbid videos! After a tiny bit of searching, the series was called
        <i>Bunnies very useful Scientific Facts</i>.
