    <h1>Cheapo Phones</h1>
    <h4>January 24, 2025</h4>

    <p>I'm gonna go over my last phones I remember having! And I'll end with the one I am typing this on now.</p>

    <span class="hide">2017-2018</span>

    <h2><a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_j7_v-8778.php">Samsung Galaxy J7 V</a></h2>

    <p>One of the more earlier phones I can remember using is a Galaxy J7, this was one of many Samsung devices I have owned.
    This also had a brief experience with Samsung Cloud that stored childhood drawings.</p>

    <h2><a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/lg_aristo_2-9047.php">LG Aristo 2</a></h2>

    <p>I really like the design of this phone out of most that I've had, it had a smooth back and a fingerprint reader.
    16:9 screen as well! I remember playing Pou on it and installing a modified APK to get more coins.</p>

    <span class="hide">2019-2020</span>

    <h2><a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_j7_(2018)-9234.php">Samsung Galaxy J7 Star</a></h2>

    <p>This phone also ended up getting lost but before that it had a nice life, complete with mobile data! It had a
    sparkly finish similar to a Nintendo 3DS and the camera was decent.</p>

    <h2><a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_j2_core_(2020)-10208.php">Samsung Galaxy J2 Core</a></h2>

    <p>Tiny cute little phone! It was bought with another J2 as part of a bundle. This phone I liked because of it's regular
    screen size, which was good for YouTube videos and old mobile games. My mom's J2 ended up breaking so I gave her mine
    and that ended up getting abandoned and I didn't know where it got lost at.</p>

    <span class="hide">2021</span>

    <h2><a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_lumia_icon-5833.php">Nokia Lumia Icon 929</a></h2>

    <p>This was a regretted eBay purchase after I found out that Microsoft Accounts can't be used on it anymore,
    and getting it's APK equivalents installed were a hassle. I did enjoy playing some games on it when I was in
    the ninth grade. The apps on it looked nice but were ridiculously underpowered, the Internet Explorer app loaded worse
    than a console browser.</p>

    <span class="hide">2023</span>

    <h2><a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/apple_iphone_5c-5690.php">iPhone 5c</a></h2>

    <p>This blue iPhone was jailbroken by me and used solely to play some iOS-exclusive games, at times I treated this as a
    little game console and just had it in my pocket. One thing that bugs me is that the Socket exploit is not permanent
    and will not work after it gets restarted.</p>

    <p>Not to mention the out-of-date iOS, I already don't like iPhones so this was a bad experience. This is also the only
    iPhone I have and when I forgot the password to the Apple ID I almost thought I locked myself out of it.
    I then reset it from the device and not the website and, yeah. iPhone.</p>

    <h2><a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/sony_xperia_z5_premium-7536.php">Sony Xperia Z5 Premium</a></h2>

    <p>Premium as in the old premium. This was a(nother) regretful ebay purchase after I found out that Japanese phones
    can't work on American networks. I would've been fine with that if it could run games without heating up the back
    glass like an electric stove. It was also too old for some apps on the Google Play Store.</p>

    <span class="hide">2024</span>

    <h2>Vortex HD65 Plus</h2>

    <p>This phone is so wack I can't even find a page for it, let alone an official one. Anyway this phone was very big and
    while I did like my old Note 3 this was just to big to fit in my pocket. The touch screen on it also weird and will
    hallucinate taps.</p>

    <h2><a href="https://www.bluproducts.com/devices/view-4/index.html">BLU View 4</a></h2>

    <p>This phone is clearly not the fastest but far from the slowest ones I had. I don't like the back of it though, it looks
    like it is from a COD game. And the anything-but-16:9 and camera placement are my pet peeves with all smartphones.</p>

    <p>I use it to watch YouTube videos, chat on Discord, and play some games while I'm at school. 
    <span class="hide">(fun fact I am writing this at school right now)</span> Sadly this phone can't handle videos with
    60FPS or else it'll tone the video down to a slideshow, and mobile games run fine enough.</p>

    <p>The problem is the long display crops games weirdly and I have a bunch of old Pac-Man mobile games on here that have
    weird borders when I open them. Some don't even open at all. <span class="hide">(Pac-Chomp! and Pac'N-Jump!)</span></p>
