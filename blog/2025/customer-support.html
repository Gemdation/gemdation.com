    <h1>Customer Support</h1>
    <h4>June 28, 2025</h4>

    <p>This is a little blog to break the months-long gap. I'll be going over most of
    the times I have been on a customer support line.</p>

    <h2>Spectrum</h2>

    <h3>2017 Password incident</h3>

    <p>The first time was likely back in 2017, right after the Time Warner merger.
    I was changing my grandma's router password after she forgot it. For a first
    contact it was surprisingly well but what is the kicker were my next
    interactions.</p>

    <h3>2021 Inactive incident</h3>

    <p>I entered a live chat with someone due to something with the My Spectrum
    app. The person really wanted me to exit it, I'd guess. He tried to push this
    'Are You Still There?' message on screen like 6 times in a row, then
    abruptly closed the chat as I was "inactive". I gave them 1 star as a result.</p>

    <h3>2022 My Spectrum incident</h3>


    <p>The My Spectrum app issue was still there so I went into a live chat
    again. I go on about what the problem is and I don't think the person was
    really experienced. At this time we had an Internet and TV service. When
    I told them about the issue, which was me not being able to use the
    My Spectrum app to control the router/modem, they said:</p>

    <p>"you don't have a router, you have Internet"</p>

    <p>I'm not even gonna go into "you don't have oxygen, you have air" type of
    statement so I just left it as is. Later on it got resolved as we got a
    new set entirely during the end of 2023.</p>

    <h3>2023 Dead Router incident</h3>

    <p>...and it was because of the following wastes of plastic and metal.</p>

    <img src="../../media/blog/spectrum-internet-set-2023.png" class="min" alt="Spectrum modem and router">

    <p>This Spectrum Internet set would not work as the router would turn off seconds after it turned on.</p>

    <p>In one of my old Reddit accounts, the router can be seen <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spectrum/comments/18cqq8d/spectrum_modem_router_give_up_after_some_seconds/">here</a>.
    Much to my dismay that I'd have to send it back, I kept the Ethernet cord though!</p>
    
    <p>One thing I'd like to mention is that there was a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spectrum/comments/18cqq8d/comment/kccbk57/">selfish commenter</a> that
    wiped their entire account with gibberish, and I unknowingly bypassed it for onlookers as I quoted it.</p>

    <p>During the end of 2023 I got my Wii and I connected it only to realize
    that the router I had was incompatible. Thankfully this was the time that the router suddenly died.</p>

    <p>In the later days, I ended up getting an older model that was compatible with the Wii!</p>

    <h2>Google</h2>

    <h3>2018 Google Play Card incident</h3>

    <p>One day while getting home from H-E-B, I had a $10 Google Play card ready to redeem.
    These cards are usually scratch-offs but I liked to peel the whole thing off.</p>

    <p>Of course this time, I accidentaly peel some letters off of the card. My aunt helped
    me get its code redeemed. Overall, the employee deserved a 5 star for making sure
    I didn't waste my money.</p>

    <h3>2021 Recent Apps incident</h3>

    <p>This was my first chat and it went really well! The issue was on my Google Pixel 3a, I
    couldn't launch the Recent Apps menu as clicking on the square icon would do nothing.</p>

    <p>The solution was to clear the cache of the Pixel Launcher. Simple enough, but I couldn't
    thank the employee since it reset the Google app.</p>

    <h3>2025 DEMO Watch incident</h3>

    <p>I'll start off by saying all I wanted was some Pac-Man plushies.</p>

    <img src="../../media/blog/ebay-pac-man-plushies-cancelled.png" class="wide" alt="Screenshot of a cancelled ebay order, set of ten various Pac-Man plushies">

    <p>The order got cancelled, so I went to look for something else to buy.</p>

    <img src="../../media/blog/ebay-pixel-watch.png" class="wide" alt="Screenshot of a delivered ebay order, a Google Pixel Watch">

    <p>Then I saw a cheap Pixel Watch to compliment my Pixel 7a and Pixel Buds that I already had.
    Skipping the wait time, I got it but I couldn't update the firmware.</p>

    <p>So I got into a support chat again, explained what I tried, tried it again because that's how support is,
    then the person brought something up.</p>

    <img src="../../media/blog/google-support-chat-1.png" class="min">

    <p>He wanted to know what serial number that watch had since it rejected OTA updates.
    This got interesting after he had to get a word in with higher-ups.</p>

    <img src="../../media/blog/google-support-chat-2.png" class="min">

    <p>...and dammit</p>

    <p>You may have also seen <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1le1spg/someone_sold_me_a_demo_pixel_watch/">this post</a>
    on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/">r/mildlyinfuriating</a>.
    The screen definitely looked like it was used in a store as it had OLED burn-in. </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="../../media/blog/pixel-watch-burn-in.png" class="wide"></td>
            <td><img src="../../media/blog/pixel-watch-update-fail.png" class="wide"></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
        

    <p>As much as I was recommended to return it, I was <em>not</em> in the mood to go through the process when
    this was supposed to be a replacement for the Pac-Man plushies.</p>

    <p>The DEMO watch's main issues were that it couldn't update itself, and had a burned-in screen. That
    honestly wasn't that bad considering I was barely using it much.</p>

    <h2>Overall</h2>

    <p>I've had quite a few tech problems so I'll send my gratitude to the people that helped
    with them...and a <i>Are You Still There?</i> message to that one guy.</p>
