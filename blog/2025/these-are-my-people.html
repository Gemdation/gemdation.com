<h1>These Are My People?</h1>
<h4>January 21, 2025</h4>

<p>I'm gonna go a little bit out of my comfort zone and talk about myself and who I interact with. But first I'll
   introduce a bit of my real life, with labels.</p>

<mark>chronically online</mark>, <mark>gay</mark>, <mark>hispanic</mark>, <mark>autistic</mark>, and <mark>grew-up-around-christian-republicans</mark>

<p>I used labels specifically becaused I know how the Internet and people in general uses labels for everyone they
   come across, I think these suit me quite well. I'm against labelling people's actions off as for one thing or
   the other since that would be inaccurate but this turned against me as I was proven wrong.</p>

<h2>Familar actions</h2>

<h3>Chris-Chan</h3>
<p><s style="color:#FF7575">NO NO NO NO NO NO NOT THE REALLY BAD STUFF</s> Anyway, while I was watching a
   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBaKst_WLcg">Chris-Chan documentary from TheGamerFromMars</a>, I thought of something quite odd. Chris-Chan enjoyed his video games,
   consoles, 4chan postings, and was also autistic. This was a weird feeling to have but I didn't think much of it.</p>

<h3>Bowblax</h3>
<p>Bowblax was the creator of the "Twitter VS" series, which I would watch frequently. Something about drama videos
   hooked me in and Bowblax (along with Optimus and Pegasus). Fast forward a <em>lot</em>, Bowblax is now seen as
   someone who was a manchild who worried about little things and ruined his channel.</p>

<h3>Planet Clue</h3>
<p>I there isn't a point to including this but I just you (the reader) to know that he is a good person, I just
   noticed something relatable about his fixation for electronics and his online presence. These were very
   similar to mine and that is what caused me to get an idea for this blog back in 2024.</p>

<h3>Tiny Honorable Mention</h3>
<p>During 2020-2022, I've seen a lot of Minecraft YouTuber stans who were also chronically online
  LGBTQ+ Twitter users.</p>

<h2>The List</h2>
<p>I noticed the very obvious pattern, so I took their trait and compared them to mine. Here they are:</p>

<ul>
   <li>Chronically online</li>
   <li>Weird inteactions on the Internet</li>
      <dd>Here's a little fact, one of my usernames (Kimbrezen) was first used on a gore website in 2020.</dd>
   <li>Childish obsessions</li>
      <dd>Nintendo, old consoles, retro games, etc.</dd>
   <li>LGBTQ+</li>
   <li>Drama viewing</li>
   <li>Immature behaviour</li>
      <dd>I talk a bit about this in my <a href="../../blog/2024/minecraft-trolling-days" style="color:lightgrey">Minecraft Trolling Days blog</a></dd>
</ul>

<p>These are concerning...</p>

<p>The chronically online people, sure, why not. Drama viewing, who isn't? But a near perfect replication of who 
   I am and what I engage with everyday? I'm not even that immature, though I was/can be a bit of an asshole on
   Discord.</p>

<p>...and speaking of Discord, it's a little depressing to hear that people like me are spending there time on
   the Internet like I am. Now that's the end of this secret little vent blog, thing, whatever. If you found this
