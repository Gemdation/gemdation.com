    <h1>So...Blogger?</h1>
    <h4>August 1, 2024</h4>

    <p>I'm here again! 4 years later I come back to Blogger since my experience with Google Sites is trash,
       Fandom has too many things going against it, and Carrd is just not what I want.</p>

    <p>Google Sites was my first type haven because it seemed like a decent website maker, the layout
       is not my favorite and the domain doesn't look nice. I stopped liking it for a pretty dumb reason, the domain.
       The default domain is sites.google.com/view/username and I don't exactly want to buy a domain for my word walls,
       so what now?</p>

    <p>Fandom is a wiki hosting website that contains free user-accessible wikis with ads and allows users to make
       personal sandbox wikis for themselves. It can be accessed on web mostly with terrible mobile support. On the wiki
       side of things, the editor is terrible to use on Firefox, it doesn't load properly and I have to refresh the page,
       the editor's syntax screws up typing, and the advertisements that are shoved everywhere.</p>

    <p>Carrd? Well, I want more than one page.</p>

    <p>Blogger is a Google service I stumbled upon during 2021, the year of me being on every single social network in
       existence because of Minecraft YouTubers. Now that I'm back here I kinda wonder how I can make use of this site.
       Google recently discontinued their goo.gl link shortener, I wouldn't exactly call them good at preserving web
       services for even more reasons too.</p>

    <p>There isn't exactly a red flag that shows that Blogger is subject to being sent to the Google graveyard but that
       doesn't mean that it it is out of the question for me. When Stadia got shut down it was having a normal day before
       everything came to a halt.</p>

    <p>Well, I want a typing haven with a cool subdomain for free, here it is. I guess I'll type away â˜º</p>
