<h1>PlushTuber Apocalypse: <span style="color:red">AnimeBroMii</span></h1>
<h4>December 17, 2024</h4>

<p>I believe the first ever "PlushTuber" I have seen was AnimeBroMii which was because of a Raving Rabbids 2
   video. It was very unique at the time, Mario plushies in-character going around and playing a Wii game.</p>

<p>AnimeBroMii was quite the pioneer for this niche genre, and was very well at their voice acting.
   I'll shed some light on the other plushie videos that I saw.</p>

<ul>
   <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEEiO_J3sV4">Mario and friends go swimming</a></li>
   <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIvlTxlPVbc">Mario, Sonic and friends in a Hotel</a></li>
   <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Sn4wLwA67k">Cooking With Chef Mario!</a></li>
   <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1PBAITvTs">Mario & Luigi Go To The Park!</a></li>
   <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W31uXIp6uaU">20 Ways To Kill Toad!</a></li>
      <dd>I'm in awe of how the british accent sounds at <a href="https://youtu.be/W31uXIp6uaU?si=D0xzaOLrXXI84KkI&t=19" style="color:rgb(128, 128, 0)">0:19</a></dd>
   <li>Video with Mario and Luigi figurines and a DS Lite</li>
      <dd>They play mini games from New Super Mario Bros. which was launched from a list of games on the DS.
          Now that I'm older I know that the list was likely from a flashcard.<a href="#note1">¹</a></dd>
   <li>Another video with Mario and Luigi figurines and a DSi</li>
      <dd>There isn't much I remember about it but they used the DSi Shop and downloaded a title and viewed their own YouTube channel on the DSi Browser.</dd>
   <li>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKFfr-2QVlhQcxRP-i1ParlgKCae4jFkL">Mario Quest</a> series</li>
      <dd>which I'll get more in to later.</dd>
</ul>

<h2>AnimeBroMii</h2>

<p>Here is a fun fact, I remember the Wii U mostly becuase of their channel played a decent amount of Wii U games.
   When I played <a href="../../library/games">Super Mario 3D World</a> I knew where a lot of the stars were because
   I remember where they screwed up at.</p>

<p>Here is another fun fact, I originally wanted to create a blog called <i>Thank You 2014</i><a href="#note2">²</a> that included all off my childhood
   YouTube entertainment and that is way too much to write for. AnimeBroMii was one of the YouTubers I was going to mention.</p>

<p>ABM is a plushie channel ran by Angi(-chan) and Issac(-kun), both names inspired by anime as you can tell.
   The videos are not related to anime mostly, they contain mature-but-not-too-mature humor revolving around Mario and
   Sonic plushies alongside other characters. And of course, Angi and Issac's plushies themselves, kind of like self-insert
   characters.</p>

<p>This may not seem weird at first but at times the female plushies<a href="#note3">³</a> would complim-nevermind, it is kinda too embarrasing
   to say much. Angi seems to be the most egotistical out of all the PlushTubers, excluding a certain one. In Ask Angi, you
   can just see the ego right in the open. Likely on other social media platforms too like Twitch with his chat.</p>

<p>In a gameplay video, they vaguely called out 'copy-catters' for copying their style of content.<a href="#note4">⁴</a> What is ironic
   is that Angi and Issac already stole charatcer likeness from SuperMarioLogan with Chef Pief and the Blach Yoshis.</p>

<p>Let's-a go into some of their videos as I point out what I liked from them when I was younger.
   Also, some videos included their nephew Brian, who also got his own plushie.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9y-sjIgmdpg">Rayman Raving Rabbids 2 HD Gameplay</a></li>
<dd>This one was one of the first videos I remember seeing of them, it showed how low quality and entertaining
   they were. They also voice acted some of the characters in-game.</dd>

<li>Their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDxykMdYi-5dAG9zTVoy_PZ8GDduId61s">Super Mario 3D World</a> walkthroughs</li>
<dd>These videos were a blast to watch as they chaotically ran through every level, comedically failing at getting stars,
    stamps, etc. This actually helped me with the game later on.</dd>

<li>Their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZylk0p8wszvaoPvsqsnDbVs7N5-65EA4">Super Mario Odyssey</a> walkthroughs</li>
<dd>I barely had eighth generation consoles at the time so this was nice to see.</dd>

<li>Their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLInr1tC_ZQcE9PWI6ehHtlsN8kPeCQe-v">Tomodachi Life</a> world</li>
<dd>I believe this is the first time I saw the game.</dd>

<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tV8s5Paf-ks">Evil Tediz Stole My Wii Game!!!!!</a></li>
<dd>Piece of barely-dark humor, Conker and Mario go to retrieve a Mario and Sonic Olympics game from an evil teddy bear.
    Conker kills it and tells Mario to not tell anyone. And Yoshi swallows a Wii Remote for some reason. Adore the editing.</dd>

<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7__1t4ogdzk">Real Life Splatoon Madness!!</a></li>
<dd>An Animal Crossing villager is tending to her garden when two Splatoon kids mess it up with ink, an important thing about it
    is that the Vilager would also be used for Angi's self-inserted ego.</dd>
</ul>

<p>By 2017 I think I stopped watching them in favor of SML, ironic. And by 2022 he got exposed
   and I wasn't really watching plushies videos anymore.</p>

<p>By that time I could see that he started to corporatize the channel <span class="hidden">(if you will)</span> once his greed
   grew, so it was kinda relieving knowing that the channel wasn't exactly going in to the best direction anyway.</p>

<p>I recently re-watched his old content like the walkthroughs of Super Mario 3D World and it is oddly a weird feeling.
   I hope their nephew (and niece) won't be seeing them again. Goodbye gang<a href="#note5">⁵</a>, I'll see you another time!</p>
