    <h1>Memey</h1>
    <h4>December 31, 2024</h4>

    <p>In a more simpler time, I liked browsing through r/Memes on Reddit and subscribing to meme channels on YouTube.
    If you've heard of Grandayy, Memetastic, SMG4, and whoever else. This was also during the time when the
    whole PewDiePie and T-Series war thing was happening.</p>

    <p>These are not exactly something I look back fond on, like some people. I remember one time I was being a hater
    at the cafeteria because one kid used Instagram for memes instead of Reddit. I do like the rest of the nerdy people
    I hanged out with, they were cool.</p>

    <h2>Grandayy</h2>

    <p>Definitely a product of it's time, Grandayy was not really someone I paid attention to but I liked some of his
    videos. One of his collaborations for a fan-made YouTube rewind was cool. Later on I just didn't like his content,
    a simple sad ending.</p>

    <h2>Memetastic</h2>

    <p>Basic meme regurgitator, but it's not just that. I can't mention Memetastic without his edgy Discord server with
    quite the toxic fanbase who ironically hated him.</p>

    <p>Videos exposing him were blocked and staff were power hungry. It doesn't stop at the outside of the server,
    nothing does. Memetastic unknowingly started a hurd of spin-off servers and Discord trolls with his server, like me!</p>

    <h2>PewDiePie</h2>

    <p>It's been 5 years since I've watched any of these YouTubers, but if there is one that really needs to be here,
    it's him. Meme Review and Reddit were a big chunk of my humor back then and I'm glad it was, I wouldn't want it
    to be TikTok and Khaby Lame. Also his little Minecraft series was cool, I liked how it gave a slight revive
    to the community.</p>

    <h2>Hobo Bros</h2>

    <p>Before the storm! SMG4 was one of my favorite channels and even though I didn't like it later on I did like Hobo
    Bros. My favorite video of theirs was of them playing Super Mario Dolar. The cursed commercials reactions were cool
    and made me like reactions videos again.</p>

    <p>I don't plan to watch these YouTubers but it is nostalgic to remember what my humor was back then.
    Have a dank new year.</p>
