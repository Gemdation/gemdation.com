<h1>PlushTuber Apocalypse</h1>
<h4>December 17, 2024</h4>

<p>I believe the first ever "PlushTuber" I have seen was AnimeBroMii which was because of a Raving Rabbids 2
   video. It was very unique at the time, Mario plushies in-character going around and playing a Wii game.</p>

<p>AnimeBroMii was quite the pioneer for this niche genre, and was very well at their voice acting.
   I'll shed some light on the other plushie videos that I saw.</p>

<ul>
   <li><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEEiO_J3sV4">Mario and friends go swimming</a></b></li>
   <li><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIvlTxlPVbc">Mario, Sonic and friends in a Hotel</a></b></li>
   <li><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Sn4wLwA67k">Cooking With Chef Mario!</a></b></li>
   <li><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1PBAITvTs">Mario & Luigi Go To The Park!</a></b></li>
   <li><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W31uXIp6uaU">20 Ways To Kill Toad!</a></b></li>
      <dd>I'm in awe of how the british accent sounds at <a href="https://youtu.be/W31uXIp6uaU?si=D0xzaOLrXXI84KkI&t=19" style="color:rgb(128, 128, 0)">0:19</a></dd>
   <li>Video with Mario and Luigi figurines and a DS Lite</li>
      <dd>They play mini games from New Super Mario Bros. which was launched from a list of games on the DS.
          Now that I'm older I know that the list was likely from a flashcard.ยน</dd>
   <li>Another video with Mario and Luigi figurines and a DSi</li>
      <dd>There isn't much I remember about it but they used the DSi Shop and downloaded a title and viewed their own YouTube channel on the DSi Browser.</dd>
   <li>The <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKFfr-2QVlhQcxRP-i1ParlgKCae4jFkL">Mario Quest</a></b> series</li>
      <dd>which I'll get more in to later.</dd>
</ul>

<h2>AnimeBroMii</h2>

<p>Here is a fun fact, I remember the Wii U mostly becuase of their channel played a decent amount of Wii U games.
   When I played <a href="../../library/games">Super Mario 3D World</a> I knew where a lot of the stars were because
   I remember where they screwed up at.</p>
