<h1>MatsuMemories</h1>
<h4>November 3, 2024</h4>

<p>MatsuPlayer was <span style="color:grey">(keyword)</span> a multi-console emulator for Android, it had
   support for Nintendo DS, PlayStation, and SNES. My first <em>ever</em> emulation experiences were with this and
   cheap MetroPCS phones.</p>

<p>MatsuPlayer does not exist officially on the Google Play Store anymore, as it got taken off some time around 2020.</p>

<p>I specifically remember one time when I was waiting for the school bus I was playing a Super Mario Bros. 2 ROM hack.
   The characters looked like Power Rangers and I got more progress in it than the regular ROM.</p>

<p>This was also the first time I cheated in a game, in Super Mario World I believe I used
   a website with a dark theme to copy and paste Game Genie codes from. I made a keyhole entrance appear from nowhere!</p>

<p>The emulator supporting PlayStation was a mistake, as I downloaded a PlayStation game from CoolROM. From their domain now <span style="color:grey">(coolrom.com.au)</span>
   I am guessing that they are from Australia, that must have explained the terrible download speeds I remember. But that could've
   been the phone as it would struggle with another console more than the PlayStation.</p>

<p>In the Nintendo DS side of things, I played Mario Kart DS and can only remember how laggy it was when I was playing Waluigi Pinball.
   Don't even remember playing the other tracks.</p>


<p>For getting the ROMs, CoolROM was not the only website I used. I believe there was a website that had retro Pac-Man and Mario
   sprites that I do not know the name of, and EmuParadise.</p>

<p>And speaking of CoolROM, I remember when one time they were hacked.
   I loaded their page on Samsung Internet and then I saw a grey screen with a BSD Daemon accompanied by a foreign language. Amazing.</p>

<p>See this daemon? This was the exact one I remember seeing when going to their site. Nowawdays I have searched to see if there
   were screenshots of this incident and I see this.</p>

<p>Intriguing, another FreeBSD thing. But anyway,<br>
   I'll always remember MatsuPlayer for bringing me to the world of ROM websites and cheat codes.

<p>Here is a list of games I remember playing:</p>
<li>3D-looking Tetris PS1 game </li>
   <dd>(The Next Tetris)</dd>
<li>Mario Bros.</li>
<li>Super Mario Bros.</li>
<li>Super Mario Bros. 2</li>
<li>Super Mario Bros. 2 rom hack</li>
   <dd>(not found)</dd>
<li>Super Mario Bros. Lost Levels</li>
<li>Super Mario Bros. 3</li>
<li>Super Mario World</li>
<li>Mario Kart DS</li>
<li>SpongeBob GameBoy Advance game</li>
