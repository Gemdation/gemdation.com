    <h1>MatsuMemories</h1>
    <h4>November 3, 2024</h4>

    <p>MatsuPlayer was <span style="color:grey">(keyword)</span> a multi-console emulator for Android, it had
    support for Nintendo DS, PlayStation, and SNES. My first <em>ever</em> emulation experiences were with this and
    cheap MetroPCS phones.</p>

    <p>MatsuPlayer does not exist officially on the Google Play Store anymore, as it got taken off some time around 2020.</p>

    <p>I specifically remember one time when I was waiting for the school bus I was playing a Super Mario Bros. 2 ROM hack.
    The characters looked like Power Rangers and I got more progress in it than the regular ROM.</p>

    <p>This was also the first time I cheated in a game, in Super Mario World I believe I used
    a website with a dark theme to copy and paste Game Genie codes from. I made a keyhole entrance appear from nowhere!</p>

    <p>The emulator supporting PlayStation was a mistake, as I downloaded a PlayStation game from CoolROM. From their domain now <span style="color:grey">(coolrom.com.au)</span>
    I am guessing that they are from Australia, that must have explained the terrible download speeds I remember. But that could've
    been the phone as it would struggle with another console more than the PlayStation.</p>

    <p>In the Nintendo DS side of things, I played Mario Kart DS and can only remember how laggy it was when I was playing Waluigi Pinball.
    Don't even remember playing the other tracks.</p>

    <p>For getting the ROMs, CoolROM was not the only website I used. I believe there was a website that had retro Pac-Man and Mario
    sprites that I do not know the name of, and EmuParadise.</p>

    <p>And speaking of CoolROM, I remember when one time they were hacked.
    I loaded their page on Samsung Internet and then I saw a grey screen with a BSD Daemon accompanied by a foreign language. Amazing.</p>

    <img src="../../media/blog/bsd-daemon.png" class="min">
    <p>See this daemon? This was the exact one I remember seeing when going to their site. Nowawdays I have searched to see if there
    were screenshots of this incident and I see this.</p>
    <img src="../../media/blog/bsd-coolrom-appearance.jpg" class="wide">
    <p>Intriguing, another FreeBSD thing. But anyway,<br>
    I'll always remember MatsuPlayer for bringing me to the world of ROM websites and cheat codes.

    <p>Here is a list of games I remember playing:</p>
    <li>3D-looking Tetris PS1 game </li>
    <dd>(The Next Tetris)</dd>
    <li>Mario Bros.</li>
    <li>Super Mario Bros.</li>
    <li>Super Mario Bros. 2</li>
    <li>Super Mario Bros. 2 rom hack</li>
    <dd>(not found)</dd>
    <li>Super Mario Bros. Lost Levels</li>
    <li>Super Mario Bros. 3</li>
    <li>Super Mario World</li>
    <li>Mario Kart DS</li>
    <li>SpongeBob GameBoy Advance game</li>
    <dd>(SpongeBob SquarePants: SuperSponge)</dd>
