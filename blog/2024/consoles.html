    <h1>Consoles</h1>
    <h4>August 2, 2024</h4>

    <p>Ever since I started playing video games, I have always had a fascination for game consoles. One of
       those especially being the Wii, along with the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. I have had 3 Nintendo consoles,
       2 Xbox consoles, and 3 PlayStation consoles.</p>

    <h2>Sixth generation</h2>

    <h3>PlayStation 2</h3>
    <p>This one is unironically memorable to me with the system menu rather than it's games, it was where I played
       Pac-Man World 2 and where I watched many DVD movies. Otherwise, I remember this console for being the subject
       of many YouTube videos I have watched.</p>

    <h2>Seventh generation</h2>

    <h3>Xbox 360</h3>

    <p>I feel like this one is where I had my start on playing 'casual'<!--formerly 'obscure'--> games on Xbox Live Arcade.
       I played Pac-Man Championship Edition, Peggle, Pac-Man, Galaga, Galaga Legions, Bejeweled 2/3 and possibly Mercury Hg.
       I tried to emulate this console on my computer and failed sadly due to Xenia not allowing custom button inputs at
       the time.</p>

    <h3>PlayStation 3</h3>

    <p>This one has to be my second favorite to the Wii, it was where I had my first start on an actual latest console
       (at the time). I played Galaga Legions DX, Pac-Man Championship Edition DX+, LEGO Indiana Jones, and mercuryHg
       on this console. The user interface is one of the reasons I liked it so much. When I had this console I didn't
       really know how to use certain apps on the console, I thought they just looked nice.</p>
    
    <h3>Wii</h3>

    <h4>2014-2015</h4>
    
    <p>The most memorable and only console I care about enough to buy and not emulate, it was where I played around with apps
       (called "Wii Channels") and played Nintendo games. This console was where I played New Super Mario Bros. Wii, Mario Kart
       Wii, Super Mario Galaxy 2, Mario Party 9, Squeeballs Party. I also had the Wii mini revision around 2016.</p>

    <h3>2023-present</h3>

    <p>When I bought my computer, I installed Dolphin Emulator and had a look back at the Wii. I also found out about
       3 new channels made by a homebrew project called WiiLink. I ordered a Wii in November 2023 and a month later I got
       a Wii again. Since it is an old Nintendo console there would be homebrew for it, and that would include the
       RiiConnect24 service (now know under WiiLink) which opened more content to the Wii.</p>

    <h3>DSi</h3>

    <p>For this little handheld console, I remember only playing the game Mario Kart DS and...browsing the system apps.
       With only one game you can only do so much but at least I had fun with it's apps.</p>

    <h2>Eight generation</h2>

    <h3>Nintendo 3DS</h3>
    <p>This handheld is where I first played Mario Kart 7, Tomodachi Life, Face Raiders, StreetPass Mii Plaza mini games
       and watched Annoying Orange on YouTube. I also used the Swapdoodle and Nintendo Badge Arcade app, and yes, I wasn't
       given money for the eShop so I just used the 3 free plays. The operating system and apps are something I memorize a lot.</p>

    <h3>PlayStation 4</h3>
    <p>This console is one that I remember using primarily to watch YouTube and play Minecraft and some PlayStation
       Now-emulated games. This console was my technically my last interest in current generation consoles, I did have
       an original Xbox One at one point but never got around to using it.</p>
