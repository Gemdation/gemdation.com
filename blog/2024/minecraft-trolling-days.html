<h1>Minecraft Trolling Days</h1>
<h4>November 24, 2024</h4>

<p>In this blog I'll summarize the trolling days of <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/play/user/BlueWave80">BlueWave80</a>, my old Xbox account that was used for Minecraft
   Bedrock. Judging from the achievements, things that took place were from 2018-2019 (meaning I was 11-12).</p>

<h2>Lifeboat</h2>

<p>I noticed that there was a tiny handful of Mojang-approved servers that appeared in Minecraft. From what I can
   recall these were Mineplex, Lifeboat, The Hive, and probably some others that I don't care about but one of these
   were very important.</p>

<p>Lifeboat had a creative game mode with a neat little mini game where you'd defend a machine from mobs. And before
   I go on to the trolling I'd say screw Lifeboat for not making a permanent VIP pass. In their creative mode you were
   not given protection from griefers, which they probably took to their advantage.</p>

<p>But anyway I won't dwell on that since I don't play on servers anymore, I'll go into my first troll.</p>

<h2>Diamond's private world</h2>

<p>So there was this person I met and friend requested on Lifeboat creative, her username I'll refer to as Hellow.
   Hellow joined a private server of somebody named Diamond. We were in creative and had a goal of building a roleplay
   world, guess what happens next!</p>

<p>It's important to note that she gave everyone Operator status, and I first started out by looking at others in the
   player list and did a demote trick. I quickly demoted them to the standard role and promoted to Operator,
   this removed their flying ability and made them have to re-add their creative mode.</p>

<p>I don't remember how they reacted but it wasn't as fun as the other thing I did. I took an invisible potion and
   some TNT and went around exploding buildings, but they caught on quickly. Diamond said they were going to turn
   something on that would let them see where the invisible players were hiding, likely just something to scare off
   trolls.</p>

<p>I can't remember what I did but I of course ignored the warning, but this time I blew up my own building. And then
   I messed up during the last trick. I set everyone to survival mode and got myself a sword and immediately went to
   get someone. It was Hellow and, unlike the previous shenanigans, this one was known to everyone because of the
   chat's kill logs.</p>

<h2>Lifeboat creative incidents</h2>

<p>So on creative I was kind of upset that my creations would get destroyed despite moderators of them being there,
   so I of course went ham on the touch controls! And they couldn't do anything since we were both regular players
   in creative.</p>

<p>This got handed back to me, in a way. When I bought their UberVIP thing I claimed a plot of blocks to build a hotel
   in. The hotel was a tiny bit out of the border and some doofus broke a piece of the wall and placed a sign with
   "We broke in.", broke in to a few blocks, heh.</p>

<h2>Survival Realm</h2>

<p>So there was this survival realm that I played on and was regularly getting good in, but then it became a bit
   harder to find resources. So I went to stealing, and quickly got it handed back to me, as when I joined one time
   my little area was flooded with lava.</p>

<p>That is all I remember from that little thing except for when I saw a creeper that looked like it was placed as
   a trap, a horrible one.</p>

<h2>Creative Realm</h2>

<p>Here is a longer realm story, there was a creative realm where people could free roam and build whatever, a perfect
   choice for me! I don't remember much but it wasn't long before I started causing hell.</p>

<p>But this one had a weird thing that predated my myriad of Discord alternative accounts. So I was on the verge of
   being banned and I brought out another account with an purple-shirt Steve skin. My account had a regular blue-shirt
   and...I think I'll just refer to them by their colors.</p>

<p>Alright time to summarize:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Orange came to the realm explaining that they were a friend of Blue</li>
    <li>Orange was greeted with Purple, who warned them that Blue was going to come back with an alt account, raiding the realm</li>
    <li>Orange and Blue were both going on about whether this was a good idea, and other members of the realm had to endure this meaningless conversation</li>
</ul>

<p>All of my accounts were banned from the realm and the invite code was regenerated. I joined back on yet another
   alternative gamertag but they said that I was friends with BlueWave80, which was basically my main account for
   all of this.</p>

<p>Gamertags, accounts, trolling, it's like foreshadowing my trolls that would occur on Discord. </p>
