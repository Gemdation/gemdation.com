    <h1>Memecord Moment</h1>
    <h4>August 9, 2024</h4>

    <blockquote>The what now?</blockquote>

    <p>Memecord was a Discord server run by problematic YouTuber Memetastic, it contained toxic members, power-tripping staff,
       y'know, the fun stuff. Looking back at the server reminds me of people when they say they had an 'edgy phase' and
       while I was not one of them, I could see that server being where some gross internet people lived.</p>

    <h2>Community</h2>

    <p>The biggest part of the Discord server is what members were involved and Memecord had were a clear indicator
       of who is was for. Yeah, it was for racists and homophobes, what more is there? As with any Discord server I'm in,
       I have to goof around. I had so many alts, pretending to be so many people.</p>
    
    <h2>Staff</h2>
    <p>As for staff, they were terrible as with any shitpost server. I recall one of the admins were the reason the server
       was nuked multiple times. For those that remember Memecord, do you remember these names: Pengy, Tetra, or Bshriel?
       I've seen them around and I do have Bshriel added as a friend on Xbox, I doubt he remembrs me.</p>
       
    <h2>Remembering Memecord</h2>

    <p>Although some people say it was the most toxic server ever, I do remember having fun in 3 of the server incarnations,
       the first one being in June 2019 IIRC. If I could blame why I liked causing chaos around Discord so much it was this,
       so thanks for all the fun guys! :P</p>
