    <h1>Dogeminer:<br><i style="color:lightblue">Need More Coins!</i></h1>
    <h4>November 20, 2024</h4>

    <p>So quite recently I remembered the Doge mobile game haul I had back in 2017-2018.
    I went to the Play Store and search "doge" and find the unique games (or apps) that were interesting.</p>

    <p>There were a few games that came to mind, including 2 apps. A clicker game, a 3D Agar.io clone, VPN app,
    weather app, and a simulator game that I think is lost media. Dogeminer was the most important of these,
    as you can tell.</p>

    <p>I went to Google to search for the APK as it had been delisted, most of these have been, unfortunately.
    Additionally, I went to see if the auto clicker I used with the game was in the Play Store. It was not!
    Damn, I had purchased the ad-free version! I went to the Play Store and went through my purchase history,
    but it appears the app was <a href="https://apkpure.com/quicktouch-automatic-clicker/simplehat.clicker">
    delisted sometime around 2020</a>.</p>
    
    <p>So then I got to clicking! I liked how as the Dogecoin counter grew on, the subtitle would change.
    From what I can remember after replaying it recently, here are some lines:</p>

    <li>"You are a poor, but happy shibe."</li>
    <li>"Wow! So many coins!"</li>
    [later on in the game]
    <li>"Are you still here?"</li>
    <li>"All life in universe cease to exist. Only dogecoin remain."</li>
    
    <p>The game progresses as you buy more upgrades for your tools and team, and speaking of team...
    There is a shop where you can permanently buy other doges and kittens to help you with mining.
    <i class="grey">(wait is that legal)</i>   They help with the dogecoins greatly, and the game will give
    you a counter that shows how much they make in a second (e.g. "Dogecoins/second: 10").</p>

    <p>And the auto clicker will really get the game going! The team may have the commitment of not stopping,
    but my tool gives the counter the push it needs. Skipping some real-life days...I now have 1,000,000,000,000.
    <i class="grey">(no i did not play non-stop)</i> I found out that the Upgrades tab tricks you into thinking
    that the one at the last row is the last upgrade of the entire game. As I'm writing this I'm sure that these
    are the last two, they will be literally the longest upgrades to get.</p>
    
    <p>If the game didn't show its time enough, there was black bars on the bottom and top of my phone screen while
    playing this game. The Google Play Games integration still works, I hope Webber Robots does not remove it as
    this game kinda bugs for sign-in. Certain elements also use the classic Android style that Pou used to use.</p>
    
    <p>How fun, now let's see that Weather Doge app.</p>

    <p>It is no longer working, it was likely broken some time in 2019 due to something with OpenWeatherMap's
    API. Speaking of that, I don't remember that being there, there was Weather.com and the disabled Yahoo Weather
    as options.</p>

    <p>Oddly a shame, I vividly remember it working with my city.
    It even had customizable shadow effects for the meme texts.</p>
