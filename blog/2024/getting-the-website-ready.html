<h1>Getting the website ready</h1>
<h4>November 2, 2024</h4>
<p>After fiddling with CSS, downloading every image on the internet, and getting cheat sheets with Copilot,
   I think this website is started to look like the way I want it to.</p>
   
<p>I will now go on about how things got here.</p>

<h2>Before gemdation.com</h2>
<b><code>www.gemdation.com</code> was being used to show a Google Sites page</b>
<p>I don't like Google Sites for a few tiny reasons, mainly the heavy resource editor and the Report Site button. I don't think a report button looks good for any site.</p>
<b>I wanted to have a website I made that could be accessible</b>
<p>To go and do this, I made a tiny website called <a href="http://q.gemdation.com"><b>The Q</b></a> that had websites for older browsers,
   aka, Nintendo browsers. I made it with the help of W3Schools and the amazing notepad.exe</p>
<b>I learned about Visual Studio Code</b>
<p>A wonderful tool that I used to code The Q and this website, I use it alongside GitHub Desktop. <span style="color:grey">(no i do not trust the git support)</span></p>

<h2>After gemdation.com</h2>
<p>The website first started with a simple one page that explained that it was used for my sites to get rid of Google Sites being on the domain, it had simple index but got the big home page update in November.</p>
<p>The new update set the space theme of the website and was the "1.0" of it in a way.</p>

<h2>What there is now</h2>
<p>Currently there are some nice things for the website</p>
<li>CSS files, an example is a index directory that is viewable at <a href="../../css">/css</a></li>
<li>Added some special pages, such as &nbsp;&nbsp;<!--0000, go find it XD-->&nbsp;&nbsp;, a <a href="../../extras/test-zone">test zone</a>, and a <a href="../../gallery">gallery</a> page.</li>

<h2>What I will make soon</h2>
<p>See the <b>Library</b> button under the <a href="../../">home page</a>'s title? I want a page that has a 'library' of:</p>
<li>Electronics I have owned</li>
<li>Games I have played</li>
<li>Notable songs I like</li>

<p>Maybe even add RSS, but who knows...</p>
