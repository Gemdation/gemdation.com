<p>Behold, the first smartphone I ever used. It was used for playing Angry Birds, creating my first Google account,
    and creating my <span class="grey">(now deleted)</span> Facebook account.</p>

<p>This phone had issues with:</p>
<li>Game audio</li>
<dd class="grey">I remember one time Angry Birds kept playing music after I closed
    the game and that scared me enough to remove the battery</dd>
<li>Battery percentage</li>
<dd class="grey">If the battery happened to be pulled out while the number was at
    100% and I put it back in and rebooted, it would be at 40%.</dd>
<li>Anything involving the Google Play Store</li>
<li>Wi-Fi at time would disconnect</li>
<li>Being fragile in general</li>
<dd class="grey">I was very upset one time when this phone was 100% and I dropped it
    on a hard wood floor in my grandma's house, rebooted it, and saw that it went back to 20%</dd>


<p><b>Image is not the exact model</b>, I do remember it was from 2014
    (guessing by the Facebook account's date) and it did not have Android 3.0 or newer.</p>

<p>This phone right here was my mom's tiny phone that was a handy portal to YouTube.
    It was used for watching FNAF animation videos, and not used for playing the game or even let's plays.</p>
<p>Do you happen to know someone named hotdiggedydemon and EthGoesBOOM? :P</p>

<p>This was one also my mom's that I used to watch YouTube on, with a special bonus from iTunes. I watched a
    3D-animated Nickelodeon show called <i>Robot and Monster</i> that I believe was purchased from iTunes Store.
</p>
<p>On YouTube, I saw even more 3D-animated videos. Rabbid videos! After a tiny bit of searching, the series was called
    <i>Bunnies very useful Scientific Facts</i>.
